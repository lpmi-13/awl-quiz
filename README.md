# Awl Quiz

The point is to help students work on academic words, and this
app uses the Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000) to do this.

Pick a base word and fill in the missing words in the academic
sentences.

Currently the sentences are hardcoded and come from abstracts of
computer science papers on arxiv.org.

Eventually, this will use an API to serve sentences in a much
more flexible manner. This is very MVP.
